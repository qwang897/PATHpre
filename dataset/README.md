Simulation Dataset for Multi-State (MS) Proteins

MS_pair: This file lists all MS proteins identified in the simulation (PDB ID + chain ID). The first 2006 entries could be seen two state in simulation. the last entries didn't show two state, if you wish more information about this, please contact us.

path_stru.zip: This archive contains the protein structures along the transition pathway. The structures are provided in sequential frames, ranging from frame0.gro to frame19.gro. We only show proteins with clear two-states in our coarse-grained simulations.

distribution_stru.zip: This archive includes all structures distributed in the free energy landscape, 2000 frames for each protein. We only show proteins with clear two-states in our coarse-grained simulations.

SS:Â This file lists all SS proteins. (PDB ID + chain ID)
