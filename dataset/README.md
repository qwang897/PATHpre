"MS_pair": This file lists all Multi-State (MS) proteins identified in the simulation (PDB ID + chain ID). 

"SS": This file lists all Single-State (SS) proteins. (PDB ID + chain ID).

"path_stru.zip": This archive contains protein structures along the transition pathway. The structures are provided in sequential frames, ranging from frame0.gro to frame19.gro. We only show proteins with clear two-states in our coarse-grained simulations, that is, the first 2006 entries in “MS_pair". If you need data for the rest proteins, please contact us.

"distribution_stru.zip": This archive includes all structures distributed in the free energy landscape, 2000 frames for each protein. We only show proteins with clear two-states in our coarse-grained simulations.
