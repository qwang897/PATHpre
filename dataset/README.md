Simulation Dataset for Multi-State (MS) Proteins

MS_pair: This file lists all MS proteins identified in the simulation. (PDB ID + chain ID)

path_stru.zip: This archive contains the protein structures along the transition pathway. The structures are provided in sequential frames, ranging from frame0.gro to frame19.gro. We only show proteins with clear two-states in our coarse-grained simulations.

distribution_stru.zip: This archive includes all structures distributed in the free energy landscape, 2000 frames for each protein. We only show proteins with clear two-states in our coarse-grained simulations.

SS:Â This file lists all SS proteins. (PDB ID + chain ID)
